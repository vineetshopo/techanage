# TECHANAGE - to manage modules, features and components of your product

**Why? Because we don't like docs**

No need for making long docs. Although can upload them here

**Most important files - never to be deleted**

A basic Electron application needs just these files:

- `package.json` - Points to the app's main file and lists its details and dependencies.
- `main.js` - Starts the app and creates a browser window to render HTML. This is the app's **main process**.
- `index.html` - A web page to render. This is the app's **renderer process**.
